Renshi is an xhtml templating language for Ruby loosely based on Python's Genshi: http://genshi.edgewall.org/

Renshi is currently a prototype.

Example Templates
=================
Renshi markup currently mimicks Genshi markup.

<h2>$@foo</h2>

$Time.now

${[1,2,4][0]}


all evaluate.



Gem Building
============
run 
`rake gem`
then
`sudo gem install pkg/renshi-0.0.1.gem`



Rails Integration
=================
Currently, to make the prototype run with Rails you need to append the following into your environment.rb

class ActionView::Base
  def renshi_binding
    binding
  end
end
require 'renshi'
Renshi::Frameworks.rails()
