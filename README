Renshi is an xhtml templating language for Ruby loosely based on Python's Genshi: http://genshi.edgewall.org/

Renshi is currently a prototype.

Example Templates
=================
Renshi markup currently mimicks Genshi markup.


$ Interpretation
================
<h2>$@foo</h2>

$Time.now

${[1,2,4][0]}

Conditional Expression
======================

<span r:if="true">hello!</span> would render "<span>hello</span>"

<span r:if="false">goodbye!</span> will render "".


all evaluate.



Gem Building
============
run 
`rake gem`
then
`sudo gem install pkg/renshi-0.0.1.gem`



Rails Integration
=================
Currently, to make the prototype run with Rails you need to append the following into your environment.rb

class ActionView::Base
  def renshi_binding
    binding
  end
end
require 'renshi'
Renshi::Frameworks.rails()


English to Japanese
===================
Renshi (錬士 : れんし ?): instructor.

In Japanese 'renshi' refers to a martial arts master - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renshi. This meaning is an utter fluke, we started
off by swapping in 'r' instead of 'g' from genshi, and then googled the result.
