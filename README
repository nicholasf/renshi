Renshi is currently pre-release, though it can work in a project. I'm waiting until I've used it in a couple of my own before I make it a 1.0 release.

Renshi is a templating language for Ruby which is unobtrusive in HTML and XHTML structures. It is built on Nokogiri.
If you're looking for a templating language which is simple, lightweight, and won't impose itself on HTML designers, Renshi is for you!

$ Code
======
To output data on the page stick a $ in front of your expression

$foo
$Time.now

If there's a space in your expression or you need formatting around your expression use ${}

${foo},$Time.now 

To insert code in your template use $[]

$[foo = "hello world"]

$foo


Element Expressions
===================
Renshi has a small library of expressions which can be inserted into HTML or XML elements.


* If
<span r:if="true">hello!</span> would render "<span>hello</span>"

<span r:if="false">goodbye!</span> will render "".

Further elements will appear as I have time to make them or others want to contribute them. There isn't much to making them. 

See renshi/lib/renshi/conditional_expressions for how they work.

Planned element expressions:

* r:if, r:else, r:elsif
* r:while
* r:def - something like genshi's py:def

Miscellaneous
=============
Renshi documents are appended with the suffix of .ren

e.g. index.html.ren or index.ren 


Framework Integration
=====================

* Rails
Simply require the renshi gem in your code, and Renshi will make itself available.

There is a Rails 2.3.2 example app in the examples directory. Go there, start up the application, and visit http://localhost:3000/hello

I'd welcome integrations for Sinatra and Merb or XYZ framework. See renshi/lib/renshi/frameworks 


Gem Building
============
run 
`rake gem`
then
`sudo gem install pkg/renshi-0.0.2.gem`


The Usual
=========
Please report any bugs at the http://renshi.lighthouseapp.com .

Contributions are welcome. Right now it's just me. 

English to Japanese
===================
Renshi (錬士 : れんし ?): instructor.

In Japanese 'renshi' refers to a martial arts master - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renshi. 'Ren' means 'polished' and 'shi' means 'person'. 

It apparently also means 'to know another' in Mandarin.

The project was originally inspired by Genshi, http://genshi.edgewall.org - though it is significantly different in its approach.
