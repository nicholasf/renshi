Renshi is currently pre-release, though it can work in a project. I'm waiting until I've used it in a couple of my own before I make it a 1.0 release.

Renshi is a templating language for Ruby which works well with existing HTML. It is built on Nokogiri.
If you're looking for a templating language which is simple, lightweight, and won't impose itself on HTML designers, Renshi is for you!

$ Code
======
To output data on the page stick a $ in front of your expression

$foo
$Time.now

If there's a space in your expression or you need formatting around your expression use ${}

${foo},$Time.now 

To insert code in your template use $[]

$[foo = "hello world"]

$foo


Element Expressions
===================
Renshi has a small library of expressions which can be inserted into HTML or XML elements, making it easier to work with pre-existing documents.


* If
<span r:if="true">hello!</span> would render "<span>hello</span>"

<span r:if="false">goodbye!</span> will render "".

Further elements will appear as I have time to make them or others want to contribute them. 

See renshi/lib/renshi/conditional_expressions for how they work.


Miscellaneous
=============
Renshi documents are appended with the suffix of .ren

e.g. index.html.ren or index.ren 


Rails
=====
Simply require the renshi gem in your code, and Renshi will make itself available.


Gem Building
============
run 
`rake gem`
then
`sudo gem install pkg/renshi-0.0.1.gem`


The Usual
=========
Please report any bugs at the http://renshi.lighthouseapp.com .

Contributions are welcome. Right now it's just me. 

English to Japanese
===================
Renshi (錬士 : れんし ?): instructor.

In Japanese 'renshi' refers to a martial arts master - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renshi. This meaning is an utter fluke, we started
off by swapping in 'r' instead of 'g' from genshi, and then googled the result.

It apparently also means 'to know another' in Cantonese.
