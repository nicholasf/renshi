Renshi is an xhtml templating language for Ruby loosely based on Python's Genshi: http://genshi.edgewall.org/

Currently, to make the prototype run with Rails you need to append the following into your environment.rb



class ActionView::Base
  def renshi_binding
    binding
  end
end
require 'renshi'
Renshi::Frameworks.rails()
